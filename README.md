# K-Nearest-Neighbours-2

1. Implement a KNN based classifier to classify given set of features in Mushroom
Database. Missing data must be handled appropriately.(Denoted by ”?”).
2. Choose an appropriate distance measure for categorical features.
3. Experiment with different values of K(number of neighbors).
4. Report accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel
useful.
5. Implement baselines such as random guessing/majority voting and compare performance. Also, report the performance of scikit-learn’s kNN classifier. Report your
findings.
